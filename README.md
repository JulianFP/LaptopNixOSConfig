## About
This is the Nix flake that defines all my NixOS systems. Enter the folders of the individual systems to get more information about them. The following systems are defined here:
- JuliansFramework: This is my Framework laptop 13 12th Gen and my daily driver. This is the system I use the most which is why it has the most complicated configuration.
- NixOSTesting: This is a VM on my Proxmox PVE that I use for testing NixOS deployments to the Cloud
